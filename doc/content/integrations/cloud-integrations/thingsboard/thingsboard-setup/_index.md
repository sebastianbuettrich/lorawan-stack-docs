After configuring the uplink payload formatter on {{% tts %}}, follow the steps in this section to prepare the setup on ThingsBoard.

Log in to your ThingsBoard account. 

Before creating an integration, you need to define uplink and downlink data converters. To do so, first navigate to **Data converters** on the left hand menu.

Click the **+** icon in the upper right and then select **Create new converter** to create a new uplink converter.

Give a **Name** to your uplink converter, select **Uplink** as a **Type** and paste the following code in the decoder function field:

```js
var data = decodeToJson(payload);
var deviceName = data.end_device_ids.device_id;
var deviceType = data.end_device_ids.application_ids.application_id;

var result = {
    deviceName: deviceName,
    deviceType: deviceType,
    telemetry: {
         temperature: data.uplink_message.decoded_payload.temperature
    }
};

function decodeToString(payload) {
    return String.fromCharCode.apply(String, payload);
}

function decodeToJson(payload) {
    var str = decodeToString(payload);
    var data = JSON.parse(str);
    return data;
}

return result;
```

>**Note:** You can test the decoder by clicking the **Test decoder function** and submitting an uplink message from {{% tts %}} manually.

Finish by selecting **Add**.

Follow the same procedure to create a converter with **Downlink** as a **Type** and a following encoder function:

```js
var data = {
        downlinks: [{
            f_port: 2,
            confirmed: false,
            frm_payload: btoa(msg.version),
            priority: "NORMAL"
        }]
    };

var result = {
    contentType: "JSON",
    data: JSON.stringify(data),
    metadata: {
        devId: 'device_id'     //enter your device's ID here
    }
};
return result;
```

>**Note:** Replace the `device_id` in the downlink converter function with the **End device ID** value from {{% tts %}}.

Next, navigate to the **Integrations** section on the left hand menu. Add a new integration by clicking the **+** button in the upper right corner.

Give a name to your integration by filling in the **Name** field. For **Type**, choose **TheThingsIndustries**.

>**Note:** Make sure the **Enabled** and **Allow create devices or assets** checkboxes are left ticked.

For **Uplink data converter** and **Downlink data converter** choose the uplink and downlink converters you created in the previous step.

Depending on your {{% tts %}} deployment, choose **Host type**.

If you want to use TLS, enter `8883` for **Port**. Otherwise, enter `1883`.

Use the credentials of your {{% tts %}} MQTT Server as **Username** and **Password**.

>**Note:** You can check the connection with your host via port you specified using credentials you provided by pressing the **Check connection** button. If it fails, make sure you fix it.

Click the **Add** button on the bottom to finish creating the integration. 

A new device with your end device's ID will be created automatically. You can find it if you navigate to **Device groups &#8594; All** and search the end devices list. Select your device and switch to the **Latest telemetry** tab to see the telemetry data your device is sending, and use it to explore the further ThingsBoard features.
